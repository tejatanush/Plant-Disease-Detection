# Plant-Disease-Detection
Plant Disease Detection Model is designed to help users quickly and accurately identify plant diseases by simply uploading a photo of the affected plant's leaf. With the power of computer vision and deep learning, the model analyzes the image and provides instant feedback on whether the plant is healthy or suffering from a disease, along with the name of the disease.

### Applications
* Smart Agriculture Monitoring systems integrate plant disease detection models into IoT-based platforms, drones, or autonomous robots to monitor large-scale farms.
* Farmers can use smartphone apps powered by deep learning models to detect diseases in their crops simply by taking pictures.
* In controlled environments like greenhouses, plant disease detection models can be integrated into automated systems that monitor plant health continuously.
